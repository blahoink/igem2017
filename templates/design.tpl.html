<h3>Expression without Cloning!</h3>
<p>
A key advantage of cell-free systems is that they allow expression directly
from linear amplified DNA rather than from a bacterial plasmid. This enabled
our overall part design scheme of  IDT synthesized G-blocks containing each
of our AMPs between our desired 5â€™UTR and Terminator, allowing us to express
these AMPs after a single round of PCR with overhanging primers containing
promoter regions. This schema allowed us to test numerous AMPs as well as GFP
and methionine aminopeptidase under the control of two promoters without
having to go through the time consuming process of cloning a bacterial plasmid
for each expression construct.
</p>

<p>
This allows for an extremely iterative design process where a part can be conceived of,
a G-block synthesized, a PCR amplification performed, and a part tested in a
cell-free expression system within a matter of two weeks.

<h3>Experimental Plans</h3>
<p>
We set out to answer key questions concerning what level of complexity of AMP
could be produced in our cell-free system. We also wanted to discover whether
or not we could rescue AMP function through treatment with methionine aminopeptidase
in the case where a non-canonical N-terminal methionine was added to the peptide
as a start codon for expression. AMP effectivity is gauged via bacterial killing
effectivity measured by OD600 growth curves or various other assays.
Our experimental design would then be to test our panel of AMPs across promoters
and in the presence or absence of methionine aminopeptidase also produced via
cell-free reactions. Pardee 2016 reported that the AMPs that they produced in
cell-free reactions were equally viable in purified and unpurified form, therefore
purification was a step that we avoided in order to create a streamlined workflow
directly from synthesis to amplification to expression to characterization.
